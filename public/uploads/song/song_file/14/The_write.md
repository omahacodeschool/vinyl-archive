	•	In the example scenarios posited by the researchers, do you feel that either the bosses or subordinates 
	acted out of ill-will? Who do you feel was most at fault? If it's difficult for you to choose, why? (Set up 
	to fail)

	When I started reading the article I felt the language used through out was almost fictional. 
	My favorite line to point this out was about how “a bosses tight control end up hurting subordinates’ 
	performance by undermining their motivation”. Wow! That is entirely subjective! I was surprised that there 
	wasn’t enough talk about communication and feedback because, to my knowledge, those are the two biggest 
	factors that play into the productivity of employees and a healthy working environment. So, if I were to 
	point at the subordinate or the boss that acted out of ill will it would be both parties given these 
	scenarios. 

	I cannot deny the claim that in some way these scenarios do happen in life, but it is just common sense 
	that the subordinate’s should have some capacity to voice their concerns over any miscommunication or 
	misunderstandings about a task. Bosses should be open to these concerns. If they are not, then they 
	obviously care more about results than people, and this attitude, while justifiable, is not for everybody. 
	But I can’t imagine a company being successful if their employees were allowed “a lot” of slack in the 
	context of their performance. Again, I would have appreciated more details of these scenarios besides “boss 
	concerned about employee. Boss A introduces tasks adjusted to satisfy the accommodations they believe 
	employee A should have. Employee grows insecurities due to different treatment and fears of being 
	incompatible in the eyes of superiors”. It says a lot about the company in the way they treat under 
	performers when the only thing that happens is assuming lesser tasks will bring the subordinate to an 
	acceptable level to perform without talking to them.

	•	Did any of these numbers surprise you? What do you think contributes to the disparity between these 
	demographics' overall workforce share and share of the tech workforce?(tech comps and diversity)

	The numbers don’t surprise me. There is plenty of room for improvement for any industry when it comes to 
	inclusion of other persons with different demographics than the existing majority. To my knowledge, we 
	still have yet to be in a world where there are no forces that purposely hold back or limit someones access 
	to the same resources as other persons in other regions in the world, so with this in mind there are still 
	select folks everywhere that will base their decision on treating someone or some entity differently given 
	their set of demographics. 

	•	Think back to previous jobs you've had or jobs you've aspired to have. Did you see people you 
	identified with as leaders in those professions? Was that important to you? Why or why not?(tech and 
	diversity)

	I don’t have specific persons in mind, but I will say there were instances where I imagined what that 
	person had to do to be where they are today. Of course, I compared it to what I was doing, thought what 
	would I have done in the past to put me on a closer path to what that idol had done and used it as an 
	indicator as what what direction I needed to take to get closer to what I really wanted to be like in 
	future.


	•	Baker's essay focuses on the personal impact on being one of the few under-represented folks in tech 
	who get through to the other end of the job pipeline. What was something that you found remarkable about 
	her on-the-job experience?(Other side)

	Not much. I have witnessed and read work place stories involving different treatment of a person only 
	because they were different in some way. All those stories follow the same line where the their on-the-job 
	activity had some situation where another colleague makes a comment/suggestion that had something to do 
	with their under-represented aspect. Some of those colleagues in the end get a review from the manager 
	staff, others just simply reveal their bias and later apologize or try to make up for it.

	•	How much should a new employee be expected to change to fit the mold of the industry or company they 
	are entering?(other side)

	As far as it takes without giving up personal/religious virtues.



Do you think blind-hiring is a sufficient solution to addressing industry biases?(blind)

	Well, there is the part that said traditional resume screenings only allowed 20% nonwhite persons whereas 
	the blind auditioning had 60% nonwhites make it past the screen, so ya. With those numbers who wouldn’t say 
	it isn’t a solution. 
	One reason against this, is this blind hire method is being applied to companies whose job may be more 
	technical or require more credentials. Being certified in some hazard prevention or owning a professional 
	license may be critical to the job, which is more of a traditional screen than looking for an applicant 
	“blindly”.
	•	How would you compare blind-hiring to a diversity-first hiring proccess, like affirmative action?(blind)

	Affirmative action appears to specifically want persons who’s culture in history faced discrimination or 
	suffrage due to their race, sex, or religion. Blind-hiring isn’t like that. The process of making the 
	identity of the applicant visible only through the work they do is the basis for blind hiring. Affirmative 
	action needs to know the applicants biological and religious factors.
